/*! \struct cs_gwf_tpf_t
 *
 * \brief Structure to handle the modelling of miscible or immiscible two-phase
 *        flows in a porous media.

 * The model follows what is depicted in "Finite volume approximation of a
 * diffusion-dissolution model and application to nuclear waste storage"
 * O. Angelini, C. Chavant, E. Ch√©nier, R. Eymard and S. Granet in Mathematics
 * and Computers in Simulation (2011), 81 (10), pp. 2001--2017
 *
 * Main assumptions are:
 *   - No water in the gaseous phase
 *   - Incompressibility of the liquid phase
 *   - Hydrogen pressure is given by the "perfect gas" law in the gas phase and
 *     the Henry's law in the liquid phase
 *
 * The two primitive variables are the capillarity and liquid pressures with a
 * specific treatment in the saturated case (cf. the cited article or
 * Angelini's PhD thesis)
 *
 * Notations are the following :
 * - Two phases: Liquid phase denoted by "l" and gaseous phase denoted by "g"
 * - indice "c" refers to the capillarity pressure
 * - Two components: water denoted by "w" and a gaseous component (let's say
 *   hydrogen) denoted by "h". The gaseous component is present in the two
 *   phases whereas water is only considered in the liquid phase.
 *
 * The resulting linear algebraic system (one applies a linearization) is
 * defined as follows:
 *
 *                              cap.    liq
 * water mass conservation    | M_00  | M_01 ||P_c|   | b_w |
 *                            |-------|------||---| = |-----|
 * hydrogen mass conservation | M_10  | M_11 ||P_l|   | b_h |
 *
 * This is a coupled system. Coupling terms are collected inside M_01 and M_10

   * \var use_coupled_solver
   * \brief When a model relies on several coupled equations, there are two
   *        main options to build and solve the system of equations. Either use
   *        a coupled solver (and thus build a coupled system) or use a
   *        segregated approach and an associated strategy to solve the
   *        sequence of equations and apply sub-iterations. The latter case
   *        (segregated solver) corresponds to the default choice.  true if a
   *        coupled solver is used. Otherwise a segregated solver is considered
   *
   * \var use_incremental_solver
   * \brief When a model includes non-linearities it can be useful to formulate
   *        the problem using increment and to iterate on the non-linear
   *        process (for instance whith a Picard or Anderson acceleration)
   *
   * \var use_definition_on_submesh
   * \brief Consider a submesh to define the liquid saturation
   *
   * \var use_diffusion_view_for_darcy
   * \brief Use a diffusion term for the discretization of the Darcy terms in
   *        the conservation equation for the mass of hydrogen. The default
   *        option is to consuder an advection term since it should be more
   *        robust as upwinding technique can be used.
   *
   * \var nl_algo_type
   *      Type of algorithm to solve the non-linearities
   *
   * \var nl_algo_cvg
   *      Set of parameters to drive the convergence of the non-linear solver
   *
   * \var nl_relax_factor
   *      Value of the relaxation factor in the non-linear algorithm. A classical
   *      choice is between 0.70 and 0.95
   *
   * \var anderson_param
   *      Set of parameters to drive the Anderson acceleration (useful if the
   *      type of non-linear algorithm is set to the Anderson acceleration).
   *
   * \var nl_algo
   *      Structure used to manage the non-linearities
